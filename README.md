# Project Overview
The advanced Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) UI project offers a highly scalable and secure frontend solution for managing users, roles, and permissions. It features an intuitive admin dashboard with dynamic role management, access control, and comprehensive CRUD functionality. The interface is built with React, leveraging modern technologies like TypeScript, Redux Toolkit, and Tailwind CSS for enhanced performance and user experience.

# Core Features

Audit Logs: Track user activities with detailed history.

2. Role & Permission Management
Role CRUD: Create, edit, delete roles with specific permissions.
Permission Grouping: Permissions grouped into modules (e.g., User Management, Reporting, System Settings).
Permission Templates: Predefined templates for common roles (e.g., Admin, Manager, Viewer).

Email Alerts: Admins are alerted via email for critical changes.

6. Modern Design & Usability
Responsive Design: Fully responsive layout with Tailwind CSS.
Dark/Light Mode: Theme toggle for better user experience.
Accessibility (A11y): Screen-reader-friendly components.
